# Resume
# Created for Cloudability interview, initial questions
#
# Module: pingIt.py
# This python script will take entries from a list defined in the Processor function, ping each entry, return success or failure codes
# and wait 300 seconds (5 minutes) for 30 minutes (loops 7 times). Output will contain ping commands and return codes.
# 
# Functions:
# ping(host, numberOfPings)
# Pass hostname and the number of Pings to the host.
# processor()
# I use processor as a main function or method, instead of using "Main".
#
# Issues: I am not able to hide the ping command output. You can do this using subprocess, but I need to work on this method more.
# Issues: Need to export results to txt file
